 I have experience building small applications in Ruby on Rails and a working understanding of C# .NET.
            Both are MVC aka "Models Views Controllers" frameworks.
            In attempt to expand my horizons, I took a crack at the PHP framework "Laravel".
            I was delighted to find Laravel to be smooth and sleek, with almost no need for long wordy code lines.
            The syntax is sharp and direct making it a clean and fun coding experience!
            I made this basic blog with the help of some great youtube tutorials.
            It is complete with Authentication, CRUD, aka "Create Read Update Delete", and file upoading functionality.
            Feel free to give it a try! 
            You can use Email: "john@gmail.com" Password: "123456" to login.
            Thanks to Traversy Media for the great tutorials
